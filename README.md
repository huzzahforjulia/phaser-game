# phaser-game
Here's where I develop my HTML5 game for my personal website!

I'm using the [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/) framework to help me. 

The code I wrote is in [index.js](https://github.com/huzzahforjulia/phaser-game/blob/master/index.js), and my sprites are in [assets](https://github.com/huzzahforjulia/phaser-game/tree/master/assets). Feel free to peruse!
