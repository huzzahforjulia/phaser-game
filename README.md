# phaser-game
A demo game I made for an old personal website. I made a tiny pixellated version of myself that can be controlled via keyboard and easily hosted on a website because it is only written in JavaScript/HTML5/CSS.

The idea was to gamify my resume, making it explorable in a tiny pixellated museum of my personal history. I put this project on hold because I wanted to figure out a better way to make it work on mobile. 

I'm using the [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/) framework to help me. 

The code I wrote is in [index.js](https://github.com/huzzahforjulia/phaser-game/blob/master/index.js), and my sprites are in [assets](https://github.com/huzzahforjulia/phaser-game/tree/master/assets). Feel free to peruse!
